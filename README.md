# jbarteluce.net Source Code

This repo contains the source files for my personal / portfolio website, jbarteluce.net.

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using my modified version of the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme. 

The hosting is currently provided by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
